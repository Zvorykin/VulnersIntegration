Upon further investigation we found that interpretation of broken HTML/SGML and various quirks in interpretation of correctly formed, but non-sensical attribute values by various browsers also allows entering malicious HTML content. These can lead to XSS attacks.\n\n## Versions affected\n\nDrupal 4.5.0, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.5  \nDrupal 4.6.0, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3\n\n## Solution\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 4.5.x, then upgrade to Drupal 4.5.6.\n  * If you are running Drupal 4.6.x, then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.4.\n\n## Important notes\n\nWe have developed a new XSS filtering system based on Ulf Harnhammar's kses library <http://sourceforge.net/projects/kses/>. This filtering only happens for Filtered HTML content so if you are trusting a user to access the Full HTML input format then said user can enter malicious content, so please revise your input format settings.\n\nFiltered HTML now filters the style attribute unconditionally.\n\nFilter writers can access this mechanism through the new filter_xss() function.\n",

      "description": "**Content moderation - Moderately critical - Access bypass - Drupal 8 **\n\nIn some conditions, content moderation fails to check a users access to use certain transitions, leading to an access bypass.\n\nIn order to fix this issue, the following changes have been made to content moderation which may have implications for backwards compatibility:\n\n`ModerationStateConstraintValidator`\n    Two additional services have been injected into this service. Anyone subclassing this service must ensure these additional dependencies are passed to the constructor, if the constructor has been overridden.\n`StateTransitionValidationInterface`\n    An additional method has been added to this interface. Implementations of this interface which do not extend the `StateTransitionValidation` should implement this method. \n\nImplementations which _do_ extend from the `StateTransitionValidation` should ensure any behavioural changes they have made are also reflected in this new method.\n\nUser permissions\n    Previously users who didn't have access to use any content moderation transitions were granted implicit access to update content provided the state of the content did not change. Now access to an associated transition will be validated for all users in scenarios where the state of content does not change between revisions.\n\nReported by\n\n  * [Roland Kovacsics ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3528385>)\n  * [attilatilman ](<https://www.drupal.org/u/attilatilman>)\n\nFixed by\n\n  * [Jess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Wim Leers ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99777>)\n  * [Daniel Wehner ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99340>)\n  * [Sam Becker ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1485048>)\n  * [Tim Millwood ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/227849>)\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n**External URL injection through URL aliases - Moderately Critical - Open Redirect - Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 **\n\nThe path module allows users with the 'administer paths' to create pretty URLs for content.\n\nIn certain circumstances the user can enter a particular path that triggers an open redirect to a malicious url.\n\nThe issue is mitigated by the fact that the user needs the administer paths permission to exploit.\n\nReported by\n\n  * [dyates ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3426845>)\n\nFixed by\n\n  * [Dave Reid ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/53892>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Peter Wolanin ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/49851>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Jess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Bronstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/78040>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Nathaniel Catchpole ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/35733>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ted Bowman ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/240860>)Provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n\n**Anonymous Open Redirect - Moderately Critical - Open Redirect - Drupal 8 **\n\nDrupal core and contributed modules frequently use a \"destination\" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability has been publicly documented.\n\n##### RedirectResponseSubscriber event handler removal\n\nAs part of the fix, `\\Drupal\\Core\\EventSubscriber\\RedirectResponseSubscriber::sanitizeDestination` has been removed, although this is a public function, it is not considered an API as per our [API policy for event subscribers](<https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy#paramconverters>).  \nIf you have extended that class or are calling that method, you should review your implementation in line with the changes in the patch.

This library has released a security update which impacts some Drupal configurations. Refer to [CVE-2018-1000888](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000888>) for details.\n\nSolution: \n\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.6.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.6.6](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.6>).\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.5.x or earlier, upgrade to [Drupal 8.5.9](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.9>).\n  * If you are using Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal 7.62](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.62>).\n\nVersions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.5.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.\n\nReported By: \n\n  * [Ayesh Karunaratne ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/796148>)\n  * [ farisv ](<https://www.drupal.org/u/farisv>)\n\nFixed By: \n\n  * [Jess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ayesh Karunaratne ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/796148>)\n  * michieltcs\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/u/alexpott>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n### Known issues\n\nUsers are reporting seeing a fatal error when updating their sites with Drush. Site owners may be able to run `drush updb` and either `drush cc all` or `drush cr` depending on the version to complete the update. Check the status report afterward to confirm that Drupal has been updated. See <https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3026386> for details.\n\n##  Additional information\n\nNote: Going forward, Drupal core will issue individual security advisories for separate vulnerabilities included in the release, rather than lumping \"multiple vulnerabilities\" into a single advisory. All advisories released today:\n\n  * [SA-CORE-2019-001](<https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-001>)\n  * [SA-CORE-2019-002](<https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2019-002>)\n\nUpdating to the latest Drupal core release will apply the fixes for all the above advisories.\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### Installation cross site scripting\n\nA user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing a malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting attack. The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only. \n\n### Open redirection\n\nThe API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack. An attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL. No user submitted data will be sent to that URL.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Locale module cross site scripting\n\nLocale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display of language codes, native and English language names properly. While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary administrator input is allowed. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a role with the 'administer languages' permission.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Blocked user session regeneration\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is blocked can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being blocked.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.16.\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.22.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.16](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.16.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.22](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.22.tar.gz>).\n\nDrupal 5 will no longer be maintained when [Drupal 7 is released](<http://drupal.org/node/725382>). [Upgrading to Drupal 6](<http://drupal.org/upgrade>) is recommended.\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. These patches fix the security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 6.16 or Drupal 5.22.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.15 use [SA-CORE-2010-001-6.15.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2010-001/SA-CORE-2010-001-6.15.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.21 use [SA-CORE-2010-001-5.21.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2010-001/SA-CORE-2010-001-5.21.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe installation cross site scripting issue was reported by [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>) (*).  \nThe open redirection was reported by [Martin Barbella](<http://drupal.org/user/633600>).  \nThe locale module cross site scripting was reported by [Justin Klein Keane](<http://drupal.org/user/302225>).  \nThe blocked user session regeneration issue was reported by [Craig A. Hancock](<http://drupal.org/user/62850>).\n\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team.\n\n## Fixed by\n\nThe installation cross site scripting issue was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>).  \nThe open redirection was fixed by [Gerhard Killesreiter](<http://drupal.org/user/227>) and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>).  \nThe locale module cross site scripting was fixed by [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>), [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>), [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) and [Neil Drumm](<http://drupal.org/user/3064>).  \nThe blocked user session regeneration issue was fixed by [Gerhard Killesreiter](<http://drupal.org/user/227>).\n\nAll the fixes were done by members of the Drupal security team.\n",

      "description": "CVE: CVE-2011-2687\n\n### Access bypass in node listings\n\nListings showing nodes but not JOINing the node table show all nodes regardless of restrictions imposed by the node_access system. In core, this affects the taxonomy and the forum subsystem.\n\nThis issue only affects sites using a node access module such as [content access](<http://drupal.org/project/content_access>) or [forum access](<http://drupal.org/project/forum_access>). If you do not use any node access system then your site is not affected by this vulnerability. It is still considered a best practice to run the latest release and all site owners are encouraged to upgrade when they can regardless of whether or not they are affected.\n\nNote that fixing this issue in contributed modules requires a backwards-compatible API change for modules listing nodes. See <http://drupal.org/node/1204572> for more details.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 7.x only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 7.x then upgrade to Drupal [7.3](<http://drupal.org/node/1204628>) or [7.4.](<http://drupal.org/node/1204634>)\n\nThe Security Team has released both a pure security update without other bug fixes and a security update combined with other bug fixes and improvements. You can choose to either only include the security update for an immediate fix (which might require less quality assurance and testing) or more fixes and improvements alongside the security fixes by choosing between Drupal 7.3 and Drupal 7.4. Read the [announcement](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.4>) for more information.\n\nSee also the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The access bypass was reported independently by numerous people, including [Sascha Grossenbacher](<http://drupal.org/user/214652>), [Khaled Alhourani](<http://drupal.org/user/265439>), and [Ben Ford](<http://drupal.org/user/12534>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The access bypass was fixed by [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>), member of the Drupal security team\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6 and 7.\n\n### Access bypass (User module search - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nA vulnerability was identified that allows blocked users to appear in user search results, even when the search results are viewed by unprivileged users.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the default Drupal core user search results only display usernames (and [disclosure of usernames is not considered a security vulnerability](<http://drupal.org/node/1004778>)). However, since modules or themes may override the search results to display more information from each user's profile, this could result in additional information about blocked users being disclosed on some sites.\n\n### Access bypass (Upload module - Drupal 6)\n\nA vulnerability was identified that allows information about uploaded files to be displayed in RSS feeds and search results to users that do not have the \"view uploaded files\" permission.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6 only.\n\n### Arbitrary PHP code execution (File upload modules - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nDrupal core's file upload feature blocks the upload of many files that can be executed on the server by munging the filename. A malicious user could name a file in a manner that bypasses this munging of the filename in Drupal's input validation. \n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by several factors: The attacker would need the permission to upload a file to the server. Certain combinations of PHP and filesystems are not vulnerable to this issue, though we did not perform an exhaustive review of the supported PHP versions. Finally: the server would need to allow execution of files in the uploads directory. Drupal core has protected against this with a .htaccess file protection in place from [SA-2006-006 - Drupal Core - Execution of arbitrary files in certain Apache configurations](<http://drupal.org/node/65409>). Users of IIS should consider [updating their web.config](<http://drupal.org/node/1543392>). Users of Nginx should confirm that only the index.php and other known good scripts are executable. Users of other webservers should review their configuration to ensure the goals are achieved in some other way.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Access bypass (User module search - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2012-5651**\n  * Access bypass (Upload module - Drupal 6): **CVE-2012-5652**\n  * Arbitrary PHP code execution (File upload modules - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2012-5653**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.27.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.18.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.27](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.27-release-notes>).\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.18](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.18-release-notes>).\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The access bypass issue in the User module search results was reported by [Derek Wright](<http://drupal.org/user/46549>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 6 Upload module was reported by [Simon Rycroft](<http://drupal.org/user/151544>), and by [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The arbitrary code execution issue was reported by [Amit Asaravala](<http://drupal.org/user/181407>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The access bypass issue in the User module search results was fixed by [Derek Wright](<http://drupal.org/user/46549>), [Ivo Van Geertruyen](<http://drupal.org/user/383424>), [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>), and [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>), all members of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 6 Upload module was fixed by [Michaël Dupont](<http://drupal.org/user/400288>), and by [Fox](<http://drupal.org/user/426416>) and [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The arbitrary code execution issue was fixed by [Nathan Haug](<http://drupal.org/user/35821>) and [Justin Klein-Keane](<http://drupal.org/user/302225>), and by [John Morahan](<http://drupal.org/user/58170>) and [Greg Knaddison](<http://drupal.org/user/36762>) of the Drupal Security team. \n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [Jeremy Thorson](<http://drupal.org/user/148199>) QA/Testing infrastructure\n  * [Ben Jeavons](<http://drupal.org/user/91990>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Gábor Hojtsy](<http://drupal.org/user/4166>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Greg Knaddison](<http://drupal.org/user/36762>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Fox](<http://drupal.org/user/426416>) of the Drupal Security Team\n",

Internet Explorer 6 then consumes a number of subsequent UTF-8 characters. This may lead to unsafe attributes that were outside a tag for the filter to appear inside a tag for Internet Explorer 6. This behaviour can then be used to insert and execute javascript in the context of the website. \n\nWikipedia has more information about [cross site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xss>) (XSS).\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 4.7.x before version 4.7.11.\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.6.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 4.7.x then upgrade to [Drupal 4.7.11](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-4.7.11.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.6](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.6.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. \n\n  * To patch Drupal 4.7.10 use [SA-2008-006-4.7.10.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-006/SA-2008-006-4.7.10.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.5 use [SA-2008-006-5.5.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-006/SA-2008-006-5.5.patch>).\n\n## Important note\n\nDrupal 4.7.11 and 5.6 now require PHP 4.3.5 or higher as the minimum version.\n\nUse of modules that purposely insert bytes that are invalid UTF-8 characters, such as GeSHi Filter and Code Filter will cause any text using the filter to not be displayed. Disable the modules until a solution has been found. \n\n## Reported by\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered during an audit of Drupal core by Stefan Esser, Mayflower GmbH and Zend.\n\nThe Drupal security team wants to thank [Die Zeit](<http://www.zeit.de/>), who commissioned the audit, for sharing the results.\n",

      "description": "Visiting a specially crafted page, anywhere on the web, may allow that page to post forms to a Drupal site in the context of the visitor's session. To illustrate; suppose one has an active user 1 session, the most powerful administrator account for a site, to a Drupal site while visiting a website created by an attacker. This website will now be able to submit any form to the Drupal site with the privileges of user 1, either by enticing the user to submit a form or by automated means. \n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by changing passwords, posting PHP code or creating new users, for example. The attack is only limited by the privileges of the session it executes in.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 4.6.x versions before Drupal 4.6.10\n  * Drupal 4.7.x versions before Drupal 4.7.4\n\n## Solution\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 4.6.10](<http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.6.10.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 4.7.x then upgrade to [Drupal 4.7.4](<http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.7.4.tar.gz>).\n  * To patch Drupal 4.6.9 use http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-025/4.6.9.patch.\n  * To patch Drupal 4.7.3 use http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-025/4.7.3.patch.\n\nPlease note that the patches only contain changes related to this advisory, and do not fix bugs that were solved in 4.6.10 or 4.7.4.\n\n## Important note for Drupal 4.6.10\n\nAny custom forms that do not use the proper form API functions, such as raw HTML forms, will break for authenticated users and need to be updated. The easiest way to do so is to add the output of form_token() before the closing form tag. For phptemplate themes, add the following code before the closing form tag:\n\n&lt;?php print form_token() ?&gt;\n\nWe advise you test modules and themes in use before committing to an upgrade.\n\n## Important note for Drupal 4.7.4\n\nDrupal 4.7.4 adds a new form field to all forms. Contributed modules and themes that assume only specific, known form fields to be present, may break on Drupal 4.7.4. \n\nWe advise you test modules and themes in use before committing to an upgrade.\n\n## Reported by\n\nGarvin Hicking.\n",

This invalidates the HTML, makes styling with CSS hard or impossible, and can break JavaScript. A patch was committed to ensure unique IDs. This patch has a side-effect that IDs for hidden form fields in your site's HTML will change. You might need to adapt your custom CSS or JavaScript, if it refers to such a changed ID.\n",

      "description": "Recently, the Drupal security team was informed of a potential exploit that would allow untrusted code to be executed upon a successful request by a malicious user. If a dynamic script with multiple extensions such as `file.php.pps` or `file.sh.txt` is uploaded and then accessed from a web browser under certain common Apache configurations, it will cause the script inside to be executed. We deemed this exploit critical and released Drupal 4.6.7 and 4.7.1 six hours after the report was filed. The fix was to create a .htaccess file to remove _all_ dynamic script handlers, such as PHP, from the \"files\" directory.\n\nAfter continuous review, however, we've found that the fix will not work in certain Apache configurations, for example those for whom `.htaccess` FileInfo overrides are disabled. We are thus releasing 4.6.8 and 4.7.2 with a more robust `.htaccess` fix, as well as a Drupal core solution to the issue which will work under all configurations. The new behavior of Drupal's `upload.module` is to rename all uploaded files with multiple, non-numeric, and non-whitelisted extensions by any other user than the administrator. For example:\n\n`file.php.pps`  \n`this is a long file.name.txt`\n\nbecomes:\n\n`file.php_.pps`  \n`this is a long file.name_.txt`\n\n**Please note that the particular Apache configurations under which this exploit is possible will affect ANY web application on the server which allows uploads to web-accessible directories, not just Drupal.** The Drupal security team has also contacted other projects, such as WordPress, about this issue and new versions of their software have either already been released, or are forthcoming.\n\n4.7.2 also fixes a potential XSS bug with `upload.module`.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n\\- All Drupal versions before 4.6.8 and before Drupal 4.7.2.\n\n## Solution\n\nIf you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 4.6.8](<http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.6.8.tar.gz>).  \nIf you are running Drupal 4.7.x then upgrade to [Drupal 4.7.2](<http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/projects/drupal-4.7.2.tar.gz>).  \nTo patch Drupal 4.6.7 use the http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-007/4.6.7.patch.  \nTo patch Drupal 4.7.1 use the http://drupal.org/files/sa-2006-007/4.7.1.patch.\n\n## Reported by\n\nDRUPAL-SA-2006-06 issue: Lourens Veen  \nXSS vulnerability in `upload.module`: Karoly Negyesi\n",

      "description": "When outputting user-supplied data Drupal strips potentially dangerous HTML attributes and tags or escapes characters which have a special meaning in HTML. This output filtering secures the site against cross site scripting attacks via user input.\n\nCertain byte sequences that are valid in the UTF-8 specification are potentially dangerous when interpreted as UTF-7. Internet Explorer 6 and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" /&gt; tag that specifies the page content as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP header specifying the content as UTF-8. This behaviour enables malicious users to insert and execute Javascript in the context of the website if site visitors are allowed to post content. \n\nWikipedia has more information about [cross site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xss>) (XSS).\n\nIn addition, Drupal core also has a very limited information disclosure vulnerability under very specific conditions. If a user is tricked into visiting the site via a specially crafted URL and then submits a form (such as the search box) from that page, the information in their form submission may be directed to a third-party site determined by the URL and thus disclosed to the third party. The third party site may then execute a [CSRF](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>) attack against the submitted form.\n\nThis vulnerability is limited to forms present on the frontpage. The user login form is not vulnerable.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.17.\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.11.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.11](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.11.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.17](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.17.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. Theses patches fix the security vulnerability, but does not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 5.17 or Drupal 6.11.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.10 use [SA-CORE-2009-005-6.10.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-005/SA-CORE-2009-005-6.10.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.16 use [SA-CORE-2009-005-5.16.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-005/SA-CORE-2009-005-5.16.patch>).\n\nAs an alternate solution if you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can alter your page template following the pattern in the core changes. Open your theme's main page.tpl.php file as well as any other page templates like page-node.tpl.php or page-front.tpl.php and move the line that is printing $head (&lt;?php print $head ?&gt;) above line with the &lt;title&gt; tag, so that it is the first item after the &lt;head&gt;.\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe UTF-7 XSS issue was reported by [pod.Edge](<http://drupal.org/user/529960>).\n\nThe information disclosure vulnerability was reported by [Moritz Naumann](<http://moritz-naumann.com/>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\nThe Drupal security team\n",

      "description": "##  Description\n\n### Inconsistent name for term access query (Less critical - Drupal 7 and Drupal 8)\n\nDrupal provides a mechanism to alter database `SELECT` queries before they are executed. Contributed and custom modules may use this mechanism to restrict access to certain entities by implementing `hook_query_alter()` or `hook_query_TAG_alter()` in order to add additional conditions. Queries can be distinguished by means of query tags. As the documentation on [EntityFieldQuery::addTag()](<https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!entity.inc/function/EntityFieldQuery%3A%3AaddTag/7.x>) suggests, access-tags on entity queries normally follow the form `ENTITY_TYPE_access` (e.g. `node_access`). However, the taxonomy module's access query tag predated this system and used `term_access` as the query tag instead of `taxonomy_term_access`.\n\nAs a result, before this security release modules wishing to restrict access to taxonomy terms may have implemented an unsupported tag, or needed to look for both tags (`term_access` and `taxonomy_term_access`) in order to be compatible with queries generated both by Drupal core as well as those generated by contributed modules like Entity Reference. Otherwise information on taxonomy terms might have been disclosed to unprivileged users.\n\n###  Incorrect cache context on password reset page (Less critical - Drupal 8)\n\nThe user password reset form does not specify a proper cache context, which can lead to cache poisoning and unwanted content on the page.\n\n### Confirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected (Moderately critical - Drupal 7)\n\nUnder certain circumstances, malicious users could construct a URL to a confirmation form that would trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website after interacting with the form, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n\n###  Denial of service via transliterate mechanism (Moderately critical - Drupal 8)\n\nA specially crafted URL can cause a denial of service via the transliterate mechanism.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Inconsistent name for term access query: **CVE-2016-9449**\n  * Incorrect cache context on password reset page: **CVE-2016-9450**\n  * Confirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected: **CVE-2016-9451**\n  * Denial of service via transliterate mechanism: **CVE-2016-9452**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to [7.52](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.52>)\n  * Drupal core 8.x versions prior to [ 8.2.3](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.3>)\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.52](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.52>)\n  * If you use Drupal 8.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 8.2.3](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.3>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\nInconsistent name for term access query:\n\n  * [znerol](<https://www.drupal.org/user/63999>)\n\nIncorrect cache context on password reset page:\n\n  * [Charlotte Bone](<https://www.drupal.org/u/charlotteb>)\n\nConfirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected:\n\n  * [jnicola](<https://www.drupal.org/u/jnicola>)\n  * [Ezra Wolfe](<https://www.drupal.org/u/ezraw>)\n\nDenial of service via transliterate mechanism:\n\n  * [Lee Rowlands](<https://www.drupal.org/u/larowlan>) of the Drupal Security Team \n\n##  Fixed by \n\nInconsistent name for term access query:\n\n  * [znerol](<https://www.drupal.org/user/63999>)\n  * [xjm](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/David_Rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [Dave Reid](<https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-reid>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Larry Garfield](<https://www.drupal.org/u/Crell>)\n\nIncorrect cache context on password reset page:\n\n  * [Chris McCafferty](<https://www.drupal.org/u/cilefen>), provisional Drupal Security Team member\n  * [xjm](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [ Alex Pott](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [ Michael Hess](<https://www.drupal.org/u/mlhess>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [Nathaniel Catchpole](<https://www.drupal.org/u/catch>) of the Drupal Security Team \n\nConfirmation forms allow external URLs to be injected:\n\n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pwolanin>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/David_Rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team \n\nDenial of service via transliterate mechanism:\n\n  * [Lee Rowlands](<https://www.drupal.org/u/larowlan>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [Cathy Theys](<https://www.drupal.org/u/yesct>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [ Alex Pott](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team \n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pwolanin>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Daniel Wehner](<https://www.drupal.org/u/dawehner>)\n  * [Nate Haug](<https://www.drupal.org/u/quicksketch>)\n  * [Heine Deelstra](<https://www.drupal.org/u/Heine>) of the Drupal Security Team\n",

      "description": "### Denial of Service\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-1588\n\nDrupal core's text filtering system provides several features including removing inappropriate HTML tags and automatically linking content that appears to be a link. A pattern in Drupal's text matching was found to be inefficient with certain specially crafted strings. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that users must have the ability to post content sent to the filter system such as a role with the \"post comments\" or \"Forum topic: Create new content\" permission.\n\n### Unvalidated form redirect\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-1589\n\nDrupal core's Form API allows users to set a destination, but failed to validate that the URL was internal to the site. This weakness could be abused to redirect the login to a remote site with a malicious script that harvests the login credentials and redirects to the live site. This vulnerability is mitigated only by the end user's ability to recognize a URL with malicious query parameters to avoid the social engineering required to exploit the problem.\n\n### Access bypass - forum listing\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-1590\n\nDrupal core's forum lists fail to check user access to nodes when displaying them in the forum overview page. If an unpublished node was the most recently updated in a forum then users who should not have access to unpublished forum posts were still be able to see meta-data about the forum post such as the post title.\n\n### Access bypass - private images\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-1591\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images, and Image Styles which create derivative images from an original image that may differ, for example, in size or saturation. Drupal core failed to properly terminate the page request for cached image styles allowing users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view. Furthermore, Drupal didn't set the right headers to prevent image styles from being cached in the browser.\n\n### Access bypass - content administration\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-2153\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to list nodes on a site at admin/content. Drupal core failed to confirm a user viewing that page had access to each node in the list. This vulnerability only concerns sites running a contributed node access module and is mitigated by the fact that users must have a role with the \"Access the content overview page\" permission. Unpublished nodes were not displayed to users who only had the \"Access the content overview page\" permission.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.13.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [ Drupal core 7.13](<http://drupal.org/node/1558412>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The Denial of Service vulnerability was reported by [Jay Wineinger](<http://drupal.org/user/923254>) and [Lin Clark](<http://drupal.org/user/396253>).\n  * The unvalidated form redirect vulnerability was reported by [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>) of the Drupal Security Team and Katsuhiko Nakanishi.\n  * The access bypass in forum listing vulnerability was reported by [Glen W](<http://drupal.org/user/170314>).\n  * The access bypass for private images vulnerability was reported by [frega](<http://drupal.org/user/243377>), [Andreas Gonell](<http://drupal.org/user/414525>), [Jeremy Meier](<http://drupal.org/user/1271628>) and [Xenza](<http://drupal.org/user/1792496>).\n  * The access bypass for the content administration vulnerability was reported by [Jennifer Hodgdon](<http://drupal.org/user/155601>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The Denial of Service was fixed by [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The unvalidated form redirect was fixed by [Wolfgang Ziegler](<http://drupal.org/user/16747>) and [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The access bypass in forum listing was fixed by [Michael Hess](<http://drupal.org/user/102818>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Ben Jeavons](<http://drupal.org/user/91990>) of the Drupal Security Team and [xjm](<http://drupal.org/user/65776>).\n  * The Access bypass for private images was fixed by [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Greg Knaddison](<http://drupal.org/user/36762>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Xenza](<http://drupal.org/user/1792496>) and [frega](<http://drupal.org/user/243377>).\n  * The Access bypass for content administration was fixed by [Jennifer Hodgdon](<http://drupal.org/user/155601>).\n",

This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the original server.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the re-installation can only be successful if the site's settings.php file or sites directories are writeable by or owned by the webserver user. Configuring the Drupal installation to be owned by a different user than the webserver user (and not to be writeable by the webserver user) is a [recommended security best practice](<http://drupal.org/node/244924>). However, in all cases the transient conditions expose information to an attacker who accesses install.php, and therefore this security update should be applied to all Drupal 7 sites.\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-4553\n\n### Information disclosure - OpenID module\n\nFor sites using the core OpenID module, an information disclosure vulnerability was identified that allows an attacker to read files on the local filesystem by attempting to log in to the site using a malicious OpenID server.\n\nCVE: CVE-2012-4554\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.16.\n\nDrupal 6 is not affected.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.16](<http://drupal.org/node/1815904>).\n\nIf you are unable to deploy the security release immediately, removing or blocking access to install.php is a sufficient mitigation step for the arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability.\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) and [Noam Rathaus](<http://drupal.org/user/2317662>) working with Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure Program. Heine Deelstra is also a member of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The information disclosure vulnerability in the OpenID module was reported by [Reginaldo Silva](<http://drupal.org/user/2305626>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability was fixed by [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>), [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>), [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>), and [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>), all members of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The information disclosure vulnerability in the OpenID module was fixed by [Reginaldo Silva](<http://drupal.org/user/2305626>), [Christian Schmidt](<http://drupal.org/user/216078>), [Vojtěch Kusý](<http://drupal.org/user/56154>), and [Frédéric Marand](<http://drupal.org/user/27985>), and by [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>), [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>), [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>), and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n",

This bug affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\nUsers can view files attached to content which they do not otherwise have access to. This bug affects Drupal 5.x only.\n\nIf the core upload module is not enabled, your site will not be affected.\n\n## Access rules bypass\n\nA deficiency in the user module allowed users who had been blocked by access rules to continue logging into the site under certain conditions.\n\nIf you do not use the 'access rules' functionality in core, your site will not be affected.\n\nThis bug affects both Drupal 5.x and Drupal 6.x.\n\n## BlogAPI access bypass\n\nThe BlogAPI module does not implement correct validation for certain content fields, allowing for values to be set for fields which would otherwise be inaccessible on an internal Drupal form. We have hardened these checks in BlogAPI module for this release, but the security team would like to re-iterate that the 'Administer content with BlogAPI' permission should only be given to trusted users.\n\nIf the core BlogAPI module is not enabled, your site will not be affected.\n\nThis bug affects both Drupal 5.x and Drupal 6.x.\n\n## Node validation bypass\n\nA weakness in the [node module API](<http://api.drupal.org/api/function/hook_nodeapi>) allowed for node validation to be bypassed in certain circumstances for contributed modules implementing the API. Additional checks have been added to ensure that validation is performed in all cases. This vulnerability only affects sites using one of a very small number of contributed modules, all of which will continue to work correctly with the improved API. None of them were found vulnerable, so our correction is a preventative measure.\n\nThis bug affects Drupal 5.x only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.11\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.5\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.11](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.11.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.5](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.5.tar.gz>).\n\nNote: the settings.php, robots.txt and .htaccess files have not changed and can be left as they are if upgrading from the current version of Drupal.\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. The patches fix security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in these versions.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 5.10 use [SA-2008-060-5.10.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-060/SA-2008-060-5.10.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 6.4 use [SA-2008-047-6.4.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-060/SA-2008-060-6.4.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The upload module flaw was reported by [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>)*\n  * The access rules bypass was reported by [jry2000](<http://drupal.org/user/124456>) and [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>)*\n  * The BlogAPI vulnerability was reported by [Caleb Delnay](<http://drupal.org/user/115182>), [Gábor Hojtsy](<http://drupal.org/user/4166>)* and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>)*\n  * The node modules vulnerability was reported by [Derek Wright](<http://drupal.org/user/46549>)*\n\nNames marked with asterisk are members of the [Drupal security team](<http://drupal.org/security-team>).\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### OpenID association cross site request forgeries\n\nThe OpenID module in Drupal 6 allows users to create an account or log into a Drupal site using one or more OpenID identities.\n\nThe core OpenID module does not correctly implement Form API for the form that allows one to link user accounts with OpenID identifiers. A malicious user is therefore able to use [cross site request forgeries](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>) to add attacker controlled OpenID identities to existing accounts. These OpenID identities can then be used to gain access to the affected accounts.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only. \n\n### OpenID impersonation\n\nThe OpenID module is not a compliant implementation of the OpenID Authentication 2.0 specification. An implementation error allows a user to access the account of another user when they share the same OpenID 2.0 provider.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n### File upload\n\nFile uploads with certain extensions are not correctly processed by the File API. This may lead to the creation of files that are executable by Apache. The .htaccess that is saved into the files directory by Drupal should normally prevent execution. The files are only executable when the server is configured to ignore the directives in the .htaccess file.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n### Session fixation\n\nDrupal doesn't regenerate the session ID when an anonymous user follows the one time login link used to confirm email addresses and reset forgotten passwords. This enables a malicious user to fix and reuse the session id of a victim under certain circumstances.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.14.\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.20.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.14](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.14.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.20](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.20.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. Theses patches fix the security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 6.14 or Drupal 5.20.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.13 use [SA-CORE-2009-008-6.13.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-008/SA-CORE-2009-008-6.13.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.19 use [SA-CORE-2009-008-5.19.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-008/SA-CORE-2009-008-5.19.patch>).\n\n**Important note**: Some users using OpenID might not be able to use the existing OpenID associations to login after the upgrade. These users should use the one time login via password recovery to get access to their user account and re-add desired associations. These users likely had issues with OpenID logins prior to the upgrade.\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe session fixation issue was reported by [Noel Sharpe](<http://drupal.org/user/551958>).  \nOpenID impersonation was reported by [Robert Metcalf](<http://drupal.org/user/581142>).  \nOpenID association CSRF was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).  \nThe file upload issue was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).\n\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team\n\n## Fixed by\n\nThe session fixation issue was fixed by [Jakub Suchy](<http://drupal.org/user/31977>).  \nThe OpenID and file upload issues were fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>).\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### OpenID authentication bypass\n\nThe OpenID module provides users the ability to login to sites using an OpenID account.\n\nThe OpenID module doesn't implement all the required verifications from the OpenID 2.0 protocol and is vulnerable to a number of attacks.\n\nSpecifically:  \n\\- OpenID should verify that a \"openid.response_nonce\" has not already been used for an assertion by the OpenID provider  \n\\- OpenID should verify the value of openid.return_to as obtained from the OpenID provider  \n\\- OpenID must verify that all fields that are required to be signed are signed\n\nThese specification violations allow malicious sites to harvest positive assertions from OpenID providers and use them on sites using the OpenID module to obtain access to preexisting accounts bound to the harvested OpenIDs. Intercepted assertions from OpenID providers can also be replayed and used to obtain access to user accounts bound to the intercepted OpenIDs.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only. A separate [security announcement and release](<http://drupal.org/node/880480>) is published for the contributed OpenID module for Drupal 5.x. \n\n### File download access bypass\n\nThe upload module allows users to upload files and provides access checking for file downloads.\n\nThe module looks up files for download in the database and serves them for download after access checking. However, it does not account for the fact that certain database configurations will not consider case differences in file names. If a malicious user uploads a file which only differs in letter case, access will be granted for the earlier upload regardless of actual file access to that.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Comment unpublishing bypass\n\nThe comment module allows users to leave comments on content on the site.\n\nThe module supports unpublishing comments by privileged users. Users with the \"post comments without approval\" permission however could craft a URL which allows them to republish previously unpublished comments.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Actions cross site scripting\n\nThe actions feature combined with Drupal's trigger module allows users to configure certain actions to happen when users register, content is submitted, and so on; through a web based interface.\n\nUsers with \"administer actions permission\" can enter action descriptions and messages which are not properly filtered on output. Users with content and taxonomy tag submission permissions can create nodes and taxonomy terms which are not properly sanitized for inclusion in action messages and inject arbitrary HTML and script code into Drupal pages. Such a cross-site scripting attack may lead to the malicious user gaining administrative access. Wikipedia has more information about [cross-site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>) (XSS).\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.18 or 6.19.\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.23.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.18](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.18.tar.gz>) or [Drupal 6.19](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.19.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.23](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.23.tar.gz>).\n\nDrupal 5 will no longer be maintained when [Drupal 7 is released](<http://drupal.org/node/725382>). [Upgrading to Drupal 6](<http://drupal.org/upgrade>) is recommended.\n\nThe security team starts a new practice of releasing both a pure security update without other bugfixes and a security update combined with other bug fixes and improvements. You can choose to either only include the security update for an immediate fix (which might require less quality assurance and testing) or more fixes and improvements alongside the security fixes by choosing between Drupal 6.18 and Drupal 6.19. Read [the announcement](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.19>) for more information.\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe OpenID authentication bypass issues were reported by [Johnny Bufu](<http://drupal.org/user/226462>), [Christian Schmidt](<http://drupal.org/user/216078>) and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).  \nThe file download access bypass was reported by [Wolfgang Ziegler](<http://drupal.org/user/16747>).  \nThe comment unpublish bypass issue was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).  \nThe actions module cross site scripting was reported by [Justin Klein Keane](<http://drupal.org/user/302225>) and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).\n\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team.\n\n## Fixed by\n\nThe OpenID authentication issues were fixed by [Christian Schmidt](<http://drupal.org/user/216078>), [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*) and [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>) (*).  \nThe file download access bypass was fixed by [Dave Reid](<http://drupal.org/user/53892>) (*) and [Neil Drumm](<http://drupal.org/user/3064>) (*).  \nThe comment unpublish bypass issue was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).  \nThe actions module cross site scripting was fixed by [Justin Klein Keane](<http://drupal.org/user/302225>) and [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).\n\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team.\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6 and 7.\n\n### Impersonation (OpenID module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Highly critical)\n\nA vulnerability was found in the OpenID module that allows a malicious user to log in as other users on the site, including administrators, and hijack their accounts.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the malicious user must have an account on the site (or be able to create one), and the victim must have an account with one or more associated OpenID identities.\n\n### Access bypass (Taxonomy module - Drupal 7 - Moderately critical)\n\nThe Taxonomy module provides various listing pages which display content tagged with a particular taxonomy term. Custom or contributed modules may also provide similar lists. Under certain circumstances, unpublished content can appear on these pages and will be visible to users who should not have permission to see it.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs on Drupal 7 sites which upgraded from Drupal 6 or earlier.\n\n### Security hardening (Form API - Drupal 7 - Not critical)\n\nThe form API provides a method for developers to submit forms programmatically using the function drupal_form_submit(). During programmatic form submissions, all access checks are deliberately bypassed, and any form element may be submitted regardless of the current user's access level.\n\nThis is normal and expected behavior for most uses of programmatic form submissions; however, there are cases where custom or contributed code may need to send data provided by the current (untrusted) user to drupal_form_submit() and therefore need to respect access control on the form.\n\nTo facilitate this, a new, optional $form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] element has been added to the Drupal 7 form API. If this is provided and set to FALSE, drupal_form_submit() will perform the normal form access checks against the current user while submitting the form, rather than bypassing them.\n\nThis change does not fix a security issue in Drupal core itself, but rather provides a method for custom or contributed code to fix security issues that would be difficult or impossible to fix otherwise.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Impersonation (OpenID module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Highly critical): **CVE-2014-1475**\n  * Access bypass (Taxonomy module - Drupal 7 - Moderately critical): **CVE-2014-1476**\n  * Security hardening (Form API - Drupal 7 - Not critical): **No CVE** necessary.****\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.30.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.26.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.30](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.30-release-notes>).\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.26](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.26-release-notes>).\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The OpenID module impersonation issue was reported by [Christian Mainka](<https://drupal.org/user/1096424>) and Vladislav Mladenov.\n  * The Taxonomy module access bypass issue was reported by [Matt Vance](<https://drupal.org/user/88338>), and by [Damien Tournoud](<https://drupal.org/user/22211>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The form API access bypass issue was reported by [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The OpenID module impersonation issue was fixed by [Damien Tournoud](<https://drupal.org/user/22211>), [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>), [Peter Wolanin](<https://drupal.org/user/49851>), and [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>), all of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The Taxonomy module access bypass issue was fixed by [Jibran Ijaz](<https://drupal.org/user/1198144>), and by [Lee Rowlands](<https://drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The form API access bypass issue was fixed by [Damien Tournoud](<https://drupal.org/user/22211>) and [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team, and by [Marc Ingram](<https://drupal.org/user/77320>) and [Kyle Browning](<https://drupal.org/user/211387>).\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [The Drupal Security Team](<http://drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6 and 7.\n\n### Denial of service with malicious HTTP Host header (Base system - Drupal 6 and 7 - Critical)\n\nDrupal core's multisite feature dynamically determines which configuration file to use based on the HTTP Host header.\n\nThe HTTP Host header validation does not sufficiently check maliciously-crafted header values, thereby exposing a denial of service vulnerability. This vulnerability also affects sites that don't actually use the multisite feature.\n\n### Access bypass (File module - Drupal 7 - Critical)\n\nThe File module included in Drupal 7 core allows attaching files to pieces of content. The module doesn't sufficiently check permission to view the attached file when attaching a file that was previously uploaded. This could allow attackers to gain access to private files.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have permission to create or edit content with a file field.\n\nNote: The Drupal 6 [FileField](<https://www.drupal.org/project/filefield>) module is affected by a similar issue (see [SA-CONTRIB-2014-071 - FileField - Access bypass](<https://www.drupal.org/node/2304561>)) and requires an update to the current security release of Drupal 6 core in order for the fix released there to work correctly. However, Drupal 6 core itself is not directly affected.\n\n### Cross-site scripting (Form API option groups - Drupal 6 and 7 - Moderately critical)\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was found due to Drupal's form API failing to sanitize option group labels in select elements. This vulnerability affects Drupal 6 core directly, and likely affects Drupal 7 forms provided by contributed or custom modules.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it requires the \"administer taxonomy\" permission to exploit in Drupal 6 core, and there is no known exploit within Drupal 7 core itself.\n\n### Cross-site scripting (Ajax system - Drupal 7 - Moderately critical)\n\nA reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in certain forms containing a combination of an Ajax-enabled textfield (for example, an autocomplete field) and a file field.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker can only trigger the attack in a limited set of circumstances, usually requiring custom or contributed modules.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Denial of service (Base system - Drupal 6 and 7 - Critical): **CVE-2014-5019**\n  * Access bypass (File module - Drupal 7 - Critical): **CVE-2014-5020**\n  * Cross-site scripting (Form API - Drupal 6 and 7 - Moderately critical): **CVE-2014-5021**\n  * Cross-site scripting (Ajax system - Drupal 7 - Moderately critical): **CVE-2014-5022**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.32.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.29.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.32.](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.32-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.29.](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.29-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The denial of service vulnerability using malicious HTTP Host headers was reported by [Régis Leroy](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1367862>).\n  * The access bypass vulnerability in the File module was reported by [Ivan Ch](<https://www.drupal.org/user/556138>).\n  * The cross-site scripting vulnerability with Form API option groups was reported by [Károly Négyesi](<https://www.drupal.org/u/chx>).\n  * The cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Ajax system was reported by [mani22test](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2844779>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The denial of service vulnerability using malicious HTTP Host headers was fixed by [Régis Leroy](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1367862>), and by [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/user/262198>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The access bypass vulnerability in the File module was fixed by [Nate Haug](<https://www.drupal.org/user/35821>) and [Ivan Ch](<https://www.drupal.org/user/556138>), and by Drupal Security Team members [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>), [Heine Deelstra](<https://www.drupal.org/user/17943>) and [David Snopek](<https://www.drupal.org/user/266527>).\n  * The cross-site scripting vulnerability with Form API option groups was fixed by [Greg Knaddison](<https://www.drupal.org/u/greggles>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Ajax system was fixed by [Neil Drumm](<https://www.drupal.org/u/drumm>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [The Drupal Security Team](<http://drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

You can choose to either only include the security update for an immediate fix (which might require less quality assurance and testing) or more fixes and improvements alongside the security fixes by choosing between Drupal 7.5 and Drupal ~~7.6~~ 7.7. Read the [announcement](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.7>) for more information.\n\nSee also the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The File access bypass was reported by [Florian Weber](<http://drupal.org/user/254778>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The File access bypass was fixed by [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>) and [Károly Négyesi](<http://drupal.org/user/9446>), both members of the Drupal security team.\n",

This potentially allows attackers to exploit multiple attack vectors on a Drupal site, which could result in the site being compromised. This vulnerability is related to Drupal core - Highly critical - Remote Code Execution - SA-CORE-2018-002. Both SA-CORE-2018-002 and this vulnerability are being exploited in the wild.\n\n_Updated — this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild._\n\nSolution: \n\nUpgrade to the most recent version of Drupal 7 or 8 core.\n\n  * If you are running 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal 7.59](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.59>).\n  * If you are running 8.5.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.5.3](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.3>).\n  * If you are running 8.4.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.4.8](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.8>). (Drupal 8.4.x is no longer supported and we don't normally provide security releases for [unsupported minor releases](<https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview>). However, we are providing this 8.4.x release so that sites can update as quickly as possible. You should update to 8.4.8 immediately, then update to 8.5.3 or the latest secure release as soon as possible.) \n\nIf you are unable to update immediately, or if you are running a Drupal distribution that does not yet include this security release, you can attempt to apply the patch below to fix the vulnerability until you are able to update completely:\n\n  * [Patch for Drupal 8.x](<https://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/rawdiff/?h=8.5.x&id=bb6d396609600d1169da29456ba3db59abae4b7e>) (8.5.x and below)\n  * [Patch for Drupal 7.x](<https://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/rawdiff/?h=7.x&id=080daa38f265ea28444c540832509a48861587d0>)\n\nThese patches will only work if your site already has the fix from [SA-CORE-2018-002](<https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-002>) applied. (If your site does not have that fix, [it may already be compromised](<https://www.drupal.org/psa-2018-002>).)\n\nReported By: \n\n  * [David Rothstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Heine Deelstra ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Jasper Mattsson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/521118>)\n\nFixed By: \n\n  * [David Rothstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [xjm](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Samuel Mortenson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2582268>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Heine Deelstra ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Pere Orga ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2301194>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Peter Wolanin ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/49851>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Tim Plunkett ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/241634>)\n  * [Michael Hess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/102818>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Nate Lampton ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/35821>)\n  * [Jasper Mattsson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/521118>)\n  * [Neil Drumm ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3064>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Cash Williams ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/421070>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Daniel Wehner ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99340>)\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6 and 7.\n\n### Cross-site scripting (Various core and contributed modules - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nA reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed modules are affected by this issue.\n\njQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not contain this protection.\n\nAlthough the fix added to Drupal as part of this security release prevents the most common forms of this issue in the same way as newer versions of jQuery do, developers should be aware that passing untrusted user input directly to jQuery functions such as jQuery() and $() is unsafe and should be avoided.\n\nCVE: CVE-2013-0244 (a CVE was also [separately issued](<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/31/3>) for jQuery)\n\n### Access bypass (Book module printer friendly version - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nA vulnerability was identified that exposes the title or, in some cases, the content of nodes that the user should not have access to.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the bypass is only accessible to users who already have the 'access printer-friendly version' permission (which is not granted to Anonymous or Authenticated users by default) and it only affects nodes that are part of a book outline.\n\nCVE: CVE-2013-0245\n\n### Access bypass (Image module - Drupal 7)\n\nDrupal core provides the ability to have private files, including images. A vulnerability was identified in which derivative images (which Drupal automatically creates from these images based on \"image styles\" and which may differ, for example, in size or saturation) did not always receive the same protection. Under some circumstances, this would allow users to access image derivatives for images they should not be able to view.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only affects sites which use the Image module and which store images in a private file system.\n\nCVE: CVE-2013-0246\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * CVE-2013-0244\n  * CVE-2013-0245\n  * CVE-2013-0246\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.28.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.19.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.28](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.28-release-notes>).\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.19](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.19-release-notes>).\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The cross-site scripting issue in various Drupal core and contributed modules was reported by t.ashula, and by [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The access bypass issue in the Book module was reported by [Mark Lindsey](<http://drupal.org/user/1924632>).\n  * The access bypass issue in the Drupal 7 Image module was reported by [Kressin Roger](<http://drupal.org/user/1605796>), [Christian Johansson](<http://drupal.org/user/204187>), [Anders Olsson](<http://drupal.org/user/855656>) and [saschadrupal](<http://drupal.org/user/245825>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The cross-site scripting issue in various Drupal core and contributed modules was fixed by t.ashula, [Théodore Biadala](<http://drupal.org/user/598310>), [Katherine Bailey](<http://drupal.org/user/172987>), [Steve De Jonghe](<http://drupal.org/user/264148>) and [J.

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the supported Drupal core versions 6 and 7.\n\n### Multiple vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site request forgery protection (Form API validation - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nDrupal's form API has built-in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) validation, and also allows any module to perform its own validation on the form. In certain common cases, form validation functions may execute unsafe operations. Given that the CSRF protection is an especially important validation, the Drupal core form API has been changed in this release so that it now skips subsequent validation if the CSRF validation fails.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a form validation callback with potentially unsafe side effects must be active on the site, and none exist in core. However, issues were discovered in several popular contributed modules which allowed remote code execution that made it worthwhile to fix this issue in core. Other similar issues with varying impacts are likely to have existed in other contributed modules and custom modules and therefore will also be fixed by this Drupal core release.\n\n### Multiple vulnerabilities due to weakness in pseudorandom number generation using mt_rand() (Form API, OpenID and random password generation - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nDrupal core directly used the mt_rand() pseudorandom number generator for generating security related strings used in several core modules. It was found that brute force tools could determine the seeds making these strings predictable under certain circumstances.\n\nThis vulnerability has no mitigation; all Drupal sites are affected until the security update has been applied.\n\n### Code execution prevention (Files directory .htaccess for Apache - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nDrupal core attempts to add a \"defense in depth\" protection to prevent script execution by placing a .htaccess file into the files directories that stops execution of PHP scripts on the Apache web server. This protection is only necessary if there is a vulnerability on the site or on a server that allows users to upload malicious files. The configuration in the .htaccess file did not prevent code execution on certain Apache web server configurations. This release includes new configuration to prevent PHP execution on several additional common Apache configurations. If you are upgrading a site and the site is run by Apache you must fix the file manually, as described in the \"Solution\" section below.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only relates to a defense in depth mechanism, and sites would only be vulnerable if they are hosted on a server which contains code that does not use protections similar to those found in Drupal's file API to manage uploads in a safe manner.\n\n### Access bypass (Security token validation - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nThe function drupal_valid_token() can return TRUE for invalid tokens if the caller does not make sure that the token is a string.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a contributed or custom module must invoke drupal_validate_token() with an argument that can be manipulated to not be a string by an attacker. There is currently no known core or contributed module that would suffer from this vulnerability.\n\n### Cross-site scripting (Image module - Drupal 7)\n\nImage field descriptions are not properly sanitized before they are printed to HTML, thereby exposing a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a permission to administer field descriptions, for example the \"administer taxonomy\" permission to edit fields on taxonomy terms.\n\n### Cross-site scripting (Color module - Drupal 7)\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the Color module. A malicious attacker could trick an authenticated administrative user into visiting a page containing specific JavaScript that could lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack via JavaScript execution in CSS.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only take place in older browsers, and in a restricted set of modern browsers, namely Opera through user interaction, and Internet Explorer under certain conditions.\n\n### Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7)\n\nThe Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in the browser window. The Overlay module did not sufficiently validate URLs prior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be used against site users who have the \"Access the administrative overlay\" permission.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Multiple vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site request forgery protection (Form API validation): **CVE-2013-6385**\n  * Multiple vulnerabilities due to weakness in pseudorandom number generation using mt_rand() (Form API, OpenID and random password generation - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2013-6386**\n  * Code execution prevention (Files directory .htaccess for Apache - Drupal 6 and 7): **No CVE**; considered remediated through \"security hardening\"\n  * Access bypass (Security token validation - Drupal 6 and 7): **No CVE**; considered remediated through \"security hardening.\"\n  * Cross-site scripting (Image module - Drupal 7): **CVE-2013-6387**\n  * Cross-site scripting (Color module - Drupal 7): **CVE-2013-6388**\n  * Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7): **CVE-2013-6389**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.29.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.24.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.29](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.29-release-notes>).\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.24](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.24-release-notes>).\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n##  Warning: Fixing the code execution prevention may require server configuration; please read:\n\nTo fix the code execution prevention vulnerability on existing Apache installations also requires changes to your site's .htaccess files in the files directories. Until you do this, your site's status report page at admin/reports/status will display error messages about the problem. Please note that if you are using a different web server such as Nginx the .htaccess files have no effect and you need to configure PHP execution protection yourself in the respective server configuration files.\n\nTo fix this issue, you must edit or replace the old .htaccess files manually. Copies of the .htaccess files are found in the site's files directory and temporary files directory, and (for Drupal 7 only) the separate private files directory if your site is configured to use one. To find the location of these directories, consult the error messages at admin/reports/status, or visit the file system configuration page at admin/settings/file-system (Drupal 6) or admin/config/media/file-system (Drupal 7). _Note that you should only make changes to the .htaccess files that are found in the directories specified on that page. Do not change the top-level .htaccess file (at the root of your Drupal installation)._\n\nGo onto your server, navigate to each directory, and replace or create the .htaccess file in this directory with the contents described below. Alternatively, you can remove the .htaccess file from each directory using SFTP or SSH and then visit the file system configuration page (admin/settings/file-system in Drupal 6 or admin/config/media/file-system in Drupal 7) and click the save button to have Drupal create the file automatically.\n\nThe recommended .htaccess file contents are as follows.\n\n**For Drupal 6:**\n    \n    \n    # Turn off all options we don't need.\n    Options None\n    Options +FollowSymLinks\n    \n    # Set the catch-all handler to prevent scripts from being executed.\n    SetHandler Drupal_Security_Do_Not_Remove_See_SA_2006_006\n    <Files *>\n      # Override the handler again if we're run later in the evaluation list.\n      SetHandler Drupal_Security_Do_Not_Remove_See_SA_2013_003\n    </Files>\n    \n    # If we know how to do it safely, disable the PHP engine entirely.\n    <IfModule mod_php5.c>\n      php_flag engine off\n    </IfModule>\n    # PHP 4, Apache 1.\n    <IfModule mod_php4.c>\n      php_flag engine off\n    </IfModule>\n    # PHP 4, Apache 2.\n    <IfModule sapi_apache2.c>\n      php_flag engine off\n    </IfModule>\n    \n\n**For Drupal 7:**\n    \n    \n    # Turn off all options we don't need.\n    Options None\n    Options +FollowSymLinks\n    \n    # Set the catch-all handler to prevent scripts from being executed.\n    SetHandler Drupal_Security_Do_Not_Remove_See_SA_2006_006\n    <Files *>\n      # Override the handler again if we're run later in the evaluation list.\n      SetHandler Drupal_Security_Do_Not_Remove_See_SA_2013_003\n    </Files>\n    \n    # If we know how to do it safely, disable the PHP engine entirely.\n    <IfModule mod_php5.c>\n      php_flag engine off\n    </IfModule>\n    \n\nAdditionally, the .htaccess of the temporary files directory and private files directory (if used) should include this command:\n    \n    \n    Deny from all\n    \n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The form validation cross-site request forgery issue was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The non-random seed vulnerability was reported by [David Stoline](<https://drupal.org/user/329570>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The code execution prevention vulnerability was reported by [Lee Rowlands](<https://drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Miguel Jacq](<https://drupal.org/user/153206>), [artfulrobot](<https://drupal.org/user/1206300>), and [Dave Fletcher](<https://drupal.org/user/72475>).\n  * The token access bypass issue was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The Image module cross-site scripting issue was reported by [Francisco José Cruz Romanos](<https://drupal.org/user/848238>).\n  * The Color module cross-site scripting issue was reported by [Mauro Gentile](<https://drupal.org/user/1862060>).\n  * The open redirect in the Overlay module was reported by [Stephane Corlosquet](<https://drupal.org/user/52142>) of the Drupal Security Team, and by Sebastian Nerz.\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The form validation cross-site request forgery issue was fixed by [Lee Rowlands](<https://drupal.org/user/395439>) and [Klaus Purer](<https://drupal.org/user/262198>), both of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The non-random seed vulnerability was fixed by [Owen Barton](<https://drupal.org/user/19668>), [David Stoline](<https://drupal.org/user/329570>), [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>), [Damien Tournoud](<https://drupal.org/user/22211>), and [Peter Wolanin](<https://drupal.org/user/49851>), all of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The code execution prevention vulnerability was fixed by [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Morbus Iff](<https://drupal.org/user/9034>) of the Drupal Security Team, [Dan Reif](<https://drupal.org/user/454444>), [Antoine Beaupré](<https://drupal.org/user/1274>), [Miguel Jacq](<https://drupal.org/user/153206>), [Christopher Gervais](<https://drupal.org/user/368613>), and [Herman van Rink](<https://drupal.org/user/449000>).\n  * The token access bypass issue was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>), [Klaus Purer](<https://drupal.org/user/262198>), and [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>), all of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The Image module cross-site scripting issue was fixed by [Francisco José Cruz Romanos](<https://drupal.org/user/848238>), and [Peter Wolanin](<https://drupal.org/user/49851>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The Color module cross-site scripting issue was fixed by [David Rothstein](<https://drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n  * The open redirect in the Overlay module was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<https://drupal.org/user/17943>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n[The Drupal Security Team](<https://drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

      "description": "Drupal's form API has built-in support for temporary storage of form state, for example user input. This is often used on multi-step forms, and is required on Ajax-enabled forms in order to allow the Ajax calls to access and update interim user input on the server.\n\nWhen pages are cached for anonymous users (either by Drupal or by an external system), form state may leak between anonymous users. As a consequence there is a chance that interim form input recorded for one anonymous user (which may include sensitive or private information, depending on the nature of the form) will be disclosed to other users interacting with the same form at the same time. This especially affects multi-step Ajax forms because the window of opportunity (i.e. the time span between user input and final form submission) is indeterminable.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that Drupal core does not expose any such forms to anonymous users by default. However, contributed modules or individual sites which leverage the Drupal Form API under the aforementioned conditions might be vulnerable.\n\n**Note:** This security release introduces small API changes which may require code updates on sites that expose Ajax or multi-step forms to anonymous users, and where the forms are displayed on pages that are cached (either by Drupal or by an external system). See the [Drupal 6.31 release notes](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.31-release-notes>) and [Drupal 7.27 release notes](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.27-release-notes>) for more information.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * CVE-2014-2983\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.31.\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.27.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal 6.31](<https://drupal.org/drupal-6.31-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal 7.27](<https://drupal.org/drupal-7.27-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * [Daniel F.

      "description": "### File upload access bypass and denial of service (File module - Drupal 7 and 8 - Moderately Critical)\n\nA vulnerability exists in the File module that allows a malicious user to view, delete or substitute a link to a file that the victim has uploaded to a form while the form has not yet been submitted and processed. If an attacker carries out this attack continuously, all file uploads to a site could be blocked by deleting all temporary files before they can be saved.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have permission to create content or comment and upload files as part of that process.\n\n### Brute force amplification attacks via XML-RPC (XML-RPC server - Drupal 6 and 7 - Moderately Critical)\n\nThe XML-RPC system allows a large number of calls to the same method to be made at once, which can be used as an enabling factor in brute force attacks (for example, attempting to determine user passwords by submitting a large number of password variations at once).\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that you must have enabled a module that provides an XML-RPC method that is vulnerable to brute-forcing. There are no such modules in Drupal 7 core, but Drupal 6 core is vulnerable via the Blog API module. It is additionally mitigated if flood control protection is in place for the method in question.\n\n### Open redirect via path manipulation (Base system - Drupal 6, 7 and 8 - Moderately Critical) \n\nIn Drupal 6 and 7, the current path can be populated with an external URL. This can lead to Open Redirect vulnerabilities.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it would only occur in combination with custom code, or in certain cases if a user submits a form shown on a 404 page with a specially crafted URL.\n\nFor Drupal 8 this is a hardening against possible browser flaws handling certain redirect paths.\n\n### Form API ignores access restrictions on submit buttons (Form API - Drupal 6 - Critical)\n\nAn access bypass vulnerability was found that allows input to be submitted, for example using JavaScript, for form button elements that a user is not supposed to have access to because the button was blocked by setting #access to FALSE in the server-side form definition.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have access to submit a form that has such buttons defined for it (for example, a form that both administrators and non-administrators can access, but where administrators have additional buttons available to them).\n\n### HTTP header injection using line breaks (Base system - Drupal 6 - Moderately Critical)\n\nA vulnerability in the drupal_set_header() function allows an HTTP header injection attack to be performed if user-generated content is passed as a header value on sites running PHP versions older than 5.1.2. If the content contains line breaks the user may be able to set arbitrary headers of their own choosing.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that most hosts have newer versions of PHP installed, and that it requires a module to be installed on the site that allows user-submitted data to appear in HTTP headers.\n\n### Open redirect via double-encoded 'destination' parameter (Base system - Drupal 6 - Moderately Critical)\n\nThe drupal_goto() function in Drupal 6 improperly decodes the contents of $_REQUEST['destination'] before using it, which allows the function's open redirect protection to be bypassed and allows an attacker to initiate a redirect to an arbitrary external URL.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by that fact that the attack is not possible for sites running on PHP 5.4.7 or greater.\n\n### Reflected file download vulnerability (System module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Moderately Critical)\n\nDrupal core has a reflected file download vulnerability that could allow an attacker to trick a user into downloading and running a file with arbitrary JSON-encoded content.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the victim must be a site administrator and that the full version of the attack only works with certain web browsers.\n\n### Saving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles (User module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Less Critical)\n\nSome specific contributed or custom code may call Drupal's user_save() API in a manner different than Drupal core. Depending on the data that has been added to a form or the array prior to saving, this can lead to a user gaining all roles on a site.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires contributed or custom code that calls user_save() with an explicit category and code that loads all roles into the array.\n\n### Email address can be matched to an account (User module - Drupal 7 and 8 - Less Critical)\n\nIn certain configurations where a user's email addresses could be used to log in instead of their username, links to \"have you forgotten your password\" could reveal the username associated with a particular email address, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires a contributed module to be installed that permits logging in with an email address, and that it is only relevant on sites where usernames are typically chosen to hide the users' real-life identities.\n\n### Session data truncation can lead to unserialization of user provided data (Base system - Drupal 6 - Less Critical)\n\nOn certain older versions of PHP, user-provided data stored in a Drupal session may be unserialized leading to possible remote code execution.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires an unusual set of circumstances to exploit and depends on the particular Drupal code that is running on the site. It is also believed to be mitigated by upgrading to PHP 5.4.45, 5.5.29, 5.6.13, or any higher version.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued (#)\n\n  * File upload access bypass and denial of service: **CVE-2016-3162**\n  * Brute force amplification attacks via XML-RPC: **CVE-2016-3163**\n  * Open redirect via path manipulation: **CVE-2016-3164**\n  * Form API ignores access restrictions on submit buttons: **CVE-2016-3165**\n  * HTTP header injection using line breaks: **CVE-2016-3166**\n  * Open redirect via double-encoded 'destination' parameter: **CVE-2016-3167**\n  * Reflected file download vulnerability: **CVE-2016-3168**\n  * Saving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles: **CVE-2016-3169**\n  * Email address can be matched to an account: **CVE-2016-3170**\n  * Session data truncation can lead to unserialization of user provided data: **CVE-2016-3171**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.38\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.43\n  * Drupal core 8.0.x versions prior to 8.0.4\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.38](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.38-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.43](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.43-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 8.0.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 8.0.4](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-8.0.4-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\nFile upload access bypass and denial of service:\n\n  * [fnqgpc](<https://www.drupal.org/u/fnqgpc>)\n\nBrute force amplification attacks via XML-RPC:\n\n  * [Stéphane Corlosquet](<https://www.drupal.org/u/scor>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nOpen redirect via path manipulation:\n\n  * [Francesco Placella](<https://www.drupal.org/u/plach>)\n  * [Heine Deelstra](<https://www.drupal.org/u/heine>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Pere Orga](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pere-orga>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pwolanin>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nForm API ignores access restrictions on submit buttons:\n\n  * [Gábor Hojtsy](<https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Damien Tournoud](<https://www.drupal.org/u/damien-tournoud>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Daniel Kudwien](<https://www.drupal.org/u/sun>)\n\nHTTP header injection using line breaks:\n\n  * [Dave Hansen-Lange](<https://www.drupal.org/u/dalin>)\n\nOpen redirect via double-encoded 'destination' parameter:\n\n  * [Tarpinder Grewal](<https://www.drupal.org/u/tarpinder>)\n  * [Harry Taheem](<https://www.drupal.org/u/htaheem>)\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nReflected file download vulnerability:\n\n  * [Juho Nurminen](<https://www.drupal.org/u/juho-nurminen-2ns>)\n\nSaving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles:\n\n  * [Dave Cohen](<https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-cohen>)\n  * [Annie Gerard](<https://www.drupal.org/u/agerard>)\n\nEmail address can be matched to an account:\n\n  * [FengWen](<https://www.drupal.org/u/fengwen>)\n  * [Jimmy Henderickx](<https://www.drupal.org/u/strykaizer>)\n\nSession data truncation can lead to unserialization of user provided data:\n\n  * David Jardin of the Joomla Security Team\n  * [Damien Tournoud](<https://www.drupal.org/u/damien-tournoud>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Heine Deelstra](<https://www.drupal.org/u/heine>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Fixed by\n\nFile upload access bypass and denial of service:\n\n  * [fnqgpc](<https://www.drupal.org/u/fnqgpc>)\n  * [Nathaniel Catchpole](<https://www.drupal.org/u/catch>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ben Dougherty](<https://www.drupal.org/u/benjy>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands](<https://www.drupal.org/u/larowlan>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Sascha Grossenbacher](<https://www.drupal.org/u/berdir>)\n  * [Gábor Hojtsy](<https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Greg Knaddison](<https://www.drupal.org/u/greggles>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Stefan Ruijsenaars](<https://www.drupal.org/u/stefan.r>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Cathy Theys](<https://www.drupal.org/u/yesct>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pwolanin>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nBrute force amplification attacks via XML-RPC:\n\n  * [Frédéric G.

      "description": "### Impersonation (OpenID module - Drupal 6 and 7 - Critical)\n\nA vulnerability was found in the OpenID module that allows a malicious user to log in as other users on the site, including administrators, and hijack their accounts.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the victim must have an account with an associated OpenID identity from a particular set of OpenID providers (including, but not limited to, Verisign, LiveJournal, or StackExchange).\n\n### Open redirect (Field UI module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\n\nThe Field UI module uses a \"destinations\" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to new destinations after completing an action on a few administration pages. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only sites with the Field UI module enabled are affected.\n\nDrupal 6 core is not affected, but see the similar advisory for the Drupal 6 contributed CCK module: [SA-CONTRIB-2015-126](<https://www.drupal.org/node/2507753>)\n\n### Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\n\nThe Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in the browser window. The Overlay module does not sufficiently validate URLs prior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be used against site users who have the \"Access the administrative overlay\" permission, and that the Overlay module must be enabled.\n\n### Information disclosure (Render cache system - Drupal 7 - Less critical)\n\nOn sites utilizing Drupal 7's render cache system to cache content on the site by user role, private content viewed by user 1 may be included in the cache and exposed to non-privileged users.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that render caching is not used in Drupal 7 core itself (it requires custom code or the contributed [Render Cache](<https://www.drupal.org/project/render_cache>) module to enable) and that it only affects sites that have user 1 browsing the live site. Exposure is also limited if an administrative role has been assigned to the user 1 account (which is done, for example, by the Standard install profile that ships with Drupal core).\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Impersonation (OpenID module - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2015-3234**\n  * Open redirect (Field UI module - Drupal 7): **CVE-2015-3232**\n  * Open redirect (Overlay module - Drupal 7: **CVE-2015-3233**\n  * Information disclosure (Render cache system - Drupal 7): **CVE-2015-3231**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.36\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.38\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.36](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.36-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.38](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.38-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\nImpersonation in the OpenID module:\n\n  * Vladislav Mladenov\n  * [Christian Mainka](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1096424>)\n  * [Christian Koßmann](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3101253>)\n\nOpen redirect in the Field UI module:\n\n  * [Michael Smith](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1291584>)\n\nOpen redirect in the Overlay module:\n\n  * [Jeroen Vreuls](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2700643>)\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nInformation disclosure in the render cache system:\n\n  * [Nathaniel Catchpole](<https://www.drupal.org/u/catch>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Fixed by\n\nImpersonation in the OpenID module:\n\n  * [Christian Schmidt](<https://www.drupal.org/user/216078>), OpenID module maintainer\n  * [Christian Mainka](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1096424>)\n  * [Christian Koßmann](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3101253>)\n\nOpen redirect in the Field UI module:\n\n  * [Yves Chedemois](<https://www.drupal.org/user/39567>), Field UI module maintainer\n  * [Damien McKenna](<https://www.drupal.org/user/108450>) provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Pere Orga](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2301194>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nOpen redirect in the Overlay module:\n\n  * [Jeroen Vreuls](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2700643>)\n  * [Ben Dougherty](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1852732>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Katherine Senzee](<https://www.drupal.org/u/ksenzee>), Overlay module maintainer\n\nInformation disclosure in the render cache system:\n\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Wim Leers](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99777>)\n  * [willzyx](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1043862>)\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [The Drupal Security Team](<https://www.drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n## Access Bypass\n\nThe Content Translation module for Drupal 6.x enables users to make a translation of an existing item of content (a node). In that process the existing node's content is copied into the new node's submission form.\n\nThe module contains a flaw that allows a user with the 'translate content' permission to potentially bypass normal viewing access restrictions, for example allowing the user to see the content of unpublished nodes even if they do not have permission to view unpublished nodes.\n\nThis issue only affects Drupal 6.x.\n\n## Validation Bypass\n\nWhen user profile pictures are enabled, the default user profile validation function will be bypassed, possibly allowing invalid user names or e-mail addresses to be submitted.\n\nThis issue only affects Drupal 6.x.\n\n## Hardening against SQL injection\n\nA parameter passed into the node access API was not properly escaped or validated before being used in SQL queries. While there is no direct risk of SQL injection from Drupal core, it's possible that this could have presented a risk in combination with a contributed module. Additional validation has been added to eliminate this risk.\n\nThis issue affects both Drupal 5.x and Drupal 6.x.\n\n## Versions Affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.15.\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.9.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.15](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.15.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.9](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.9.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. The patches fix security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in these versions.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 5.14 use [SA-CORE-2009-001-5.14.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-001/SA-CORE-2009-001-5.14.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 6.8 use [SA-CORE-2009-001-6.8.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-001/SA-CORE-2009-001-6.8.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe access bypass issue for translations was reported by [Wolfgang Ziegler](<http://drupal.org/user/16747>).\n\nThe validation bypass was reported by [v1nce](<http://drupal.org/user/52144>), [ supersmashbrothers](<http://drupal.org/user/241667>), [Tejus Pratap](<http://drupal.org/user/360600>), and [Limiting Factor](<http://drupal.org/user/373498>).\n\nThe need for SQL hardening was reported by [Derek Wright](<http://drupal.org/user/46549>) of the Drupal Security Team.\n",

The patch fixes the security vulnerability, but does not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 5.16.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 5.15 use [SA-CORE-2009-004-5.15.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-004/SA-CORE-2009-004-5.15.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\nBogdan Calin ([www.acunetix.com](<http://www.acunetix.com>))\n",

      "description": "When outputting user-supplied data Drupal strips potentially dangerous HTML attributes and tags or escapes characters which have a special meaning in HTML. This output filtering secures the site against cross site scripting attacks via user input.\n\nCertain byte sequences that are valid in the UTF-8 specification are potentially dangerous when interpreted as UTF-7. Internet Explorer 6 and 7 may decode these characters as UTF-7 if they appear before the &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" /&gt; tag that specifies the page content as UTF-8, despite the fact that Drupal also sends a real HTTP header specifying the content as UTF-8. This enables attackers to execute cross site scripting attacks with UTF-7. [SA-CORE-2009-005 - Drupal core - Cross site scripting](<http://drupal.org/node/449078>) contained an incomplete fix for the issue. HTML exports of books are still vulnerable, which means that anyone with edit permissions for pages in outlines is able to insert arbitrary HTML and script code in these exports.\n\nAdditionally, the taxonomy module allows users with the _'administer taxonomy'_ permission to inject arbitrary HTML and script code in the help text of any vocabulary. \n\nWikipedia has more information about [cross site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>) (XSS).\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.18.\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.12.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.12](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.12.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.18](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.18.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. Theses patches fix the security vulnerability, but does not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 5.18 or Drupal 6.12.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.11 use [SA-CORE-2009-006-6.11.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-006/SA-CORE-2009-006-6.11.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.17 use [SA-CORE-2009-006-5.17.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-006/SA-CORE-2009-006-5.17.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe UTF-7 XSS issue in book-export-html.tpl.php was reported by Markus Petrux.\n\nThe XSS issue in taxonomy module was publicly disclosed.\n\n## Fixed by\n\nBoth issues were fixed by Heine Deelstra, Peter Wolanin and Derek Wright of the Drupal Security Team.\n",

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal. Neither of these are readily exploitable.\n\n### Cross site scripting\n\nFree tagging taxonomy terms can be used to insert arbitrary script and HTML code ([cross site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>) or XSS) on node preview pages. A successful exploit requires that the victim selects a term containing script code and chooses to preview the node. This issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\nSome values from [OpenID](<http://openid.net/what/>) providers are output without being properly escaped, allowing malicious providers to insert arbitrary script and HTML code (XSS) into user pages. This issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\nfilter_xss_admin() has been hardened to prevent use of the object HTML tag in administrator input.\n\n### Cross site request forgeries\n\nTranslated strings (5.x, 6.x) and OpenID identities (6.x) are immediately deleted upon accessing a properly formatted URL, making such deletion vulnerable to [cross site request forgeries](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>) (CSRF). This may lead to unintended deletion of translated strings or OpenID identities when a sufficiently privileged user visits a page or site created by a malicious person.\n\n### Session fixation\n\nWhen contributed modules such as Workflow NG terminate the current request during a login event, user module is not able to regenerate the user's session. This may lead to a [session fixation attack](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation>), when a malicious user is able to control another users' initial session ID. As the session is not regenerated, the malicious user may use the 'fixed' session ID after the victim authenticates and will have the same access. This issue affects both Drupal 5 and Drupal 6.\n\n### SQL injection\n\nSchema API uses an inappropriate placeholder for 'numeric' fields enabling [SQL injection](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection>) when user-supplied data is used for such fields.This issue affects Drupal 6 only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.8\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.3\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.8](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.8.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.3](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.3.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. The patches fix security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in these versions.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 5.7 use [SA-2008-044-5.7.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-044/SA-2008-044-5.7.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 6.2 use [SA-2008-044-6.2.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-044/SA-2008-044-6.2.patch>).\n\n## Note for site administrators\n\nDrupal 5.8 and 6.3 no longer support the use of the object HTML tag in many text supplied by administrators. Such texts include the mission statement and taxonomy term descriptions.\n\n## Notes for developers\n\nDrupal 6.3 has the new db_query placeholder %n for numeric fields (DECIMAL, NUMERIC). Custom queries should be updated to reflect this change.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The session fixation issue was reported by Erich C. Beyrent.\n  * The Taxonomy term XSS issue was reported by [John Morahan](<http://drupal.org/user/58170>).\n  * The OpenID CSRF issue was reported by [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>) (Drupal security team).\n  * The OpenID XSS issue was reported by [Neil Drumm](<http://drupal.org/user/3064>) (Drupal security team).\n  * The locale CSRF issue and the numeric SQL injection issue were reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (Drupal security team).\n",

      "description": "Project: \n\nDrupal core\n\nDate: \n\n2019-January-16\n\nSecurity risk: \n\n**Critical** 16∕25 AC:Complex/A:Admin/CI:All/II:All/E:Theoretical/TD:All\n\nVulnerability: \n\nArbitrary PHP code execution\n\nCVE IDs: \n\nCVE-2019-6339\n\nDescription: \n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in PHP's built-in phar stream wrapper when performing file operations on an untrusted phar:// URI.\n\nSome Drupal code (core, contrib, and custom) may be performing file operations on insufficiently validated user input, thereby being exposed to this vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that such code paths typically require access to an administrative permission or an atypical configuration.\n\nSolution: \n\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.6.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.6.6](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.6>).\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.5.x or earlier, upgrade to [Drupal 8.5.9](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.9>).\n  * If you are using Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal 7.62](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.62>).\n\nVersions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.5.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.\n\n### Known issues\n\nThis fix introduced a fatal error for some Drush installations when updating a site with Drush. New releases ([8.6.7](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.7>), [8.5.10](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.10>), and [7.63](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.63>)) have been issued to resolve this regression. See the release notes for additional details.\n\n### Update information\n\n#### `.phar` added to dangerous extensions list\n\nThe `.phar` file extension has been added to Drupal's dangerous extensions list, which means that any such file uploaded to a Drupal file field will automatically be converted to a text file (with the `.txt` extension) to prevent it from being executed. This is similar to how Drupal handles file uploads with a `.php` extension.\n\n#### `phar://` stream wrapper disabled by default for Drupal 7 sites on PHP 5.3.2 and earlier\n\nThe replacement stream wrapper is not compatible with PHP versions lower than 5.3.3. Drupal 8 requires a higher PHP version than that, but for Drupal 7 sites using lower PHP versions, the built-in phar stream wrapper has been disabled rather than replaced. Drupal 7 sites using PHP 5.2 (or PHP 5.3.0-5.3.2) that require phar support will need to re-enable the stream wrapper for it; however, note that re-enabling the stream wrapper will re-enable the insecure PHP behavior on those PHP versions. \n\nIt is very uncommon to both be running a PHP version lower than 5.3.3 and to need phar support. If you're in that situation, consider upgrading your PHP version instead of restoring insecure phar support.\n\nReported By: \n\n  * [Greg Knaddison ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/36762>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * Sam Thomas \n\nFixed By: \n\n  * [Cash Williams ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/421070>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Samuel Mortenson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2582268>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Jess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ted Bowman ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/240860>)\n  * [Michael Hess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/102818>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Bronstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/78040>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Fabian Franz ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/693738>)\n\n##  Additional information\n\nNote: Going forward, Drupal core will issue individual security advisories for separate vulnerabilities included in the release, rather than lumping \"multiple vulnerabilities\" into a single advisory.

      "description": "### Access bypass (Password reset URLs - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nPassword reset URLs can be forged under certain circumstances, allowing an attacker to gain access to another user's account without knowing the account's password.\n\nIn Drupal 7, this vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it can only be exploited on sites where accounts have been imported or programmatically edited in a way that results in the password hash in the database being the same for multiple user accounts. In Drupal 6, it can additionally be exploited on sites where administrators have created multiple new user accounts with the same password via the administrative interface, or where accounts have been imported or programmatically edited in a way that results in the password hash in the database being empty for at least one user account.\n\nDrupal 6 sites that have empty password hashes, or a password field with a guessable string in the database, are especially prone to this vulnerability. This could apply to sites that use external authentication so that the password field is set to a fixed, invalid value.\n\n### Open redirect (Several vectors including the \"destination\" URL parameter - Drupal 6 and 7)\n\nDrupal core and contributed modules frequently use a \"destination\" query string parameter in URLs to redirect users to a new destination after completing an action on the current page. Under certain circumstances, malicious users can use this parameter to construct a URL that will trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.\n\nIn addition, several URL-related API functions in Drupal 6 and 7 can be tricked into passing through external URLs when not intending to, potentially leading to additional open redirect vulnerabilities.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that many common uses of the \"destination\" parameter are not susceptible to the attack. However, all confirmation forms built using Drupal 7's form API are vulnerable via the Cancel action that appears at the bottom of the form, and some Drupal 6 confirmation forms are vulnerable too.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Access bypass via password reset URLs: **CVE-2015-2559**\n  * Open redirect via the \"destination\" URL parameter: **CVE-2015-2749**\n  * Open redirect via URL-related API functions: **CVE-2015-2750**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.35\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.35\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use the Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.35](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.35-release-notes>)\n  * If you use the Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.35](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.35-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\nAccess bypass via password reset URLs:\n\n  * [Daniël Smidt](<https://www.drupal.org/user/198330>)\n\nOpen redirect via vectors including the \"destination\" URL parameter:\n\n  * [Hunter Fox](<https://www.drupal.org/u/hefox>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Vlad Stratulat](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1006458>)\n  * [Michael Smith](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1291584>)\n  * [Dave Reid](<https://www.drupal.org/u/dave-reid>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Fixed by\n\nAccess bypass via password reset URLs:\n\n  * [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/David_Rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pwolanin>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ben Dougherty](<http://drupal.org/u/benjy>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n\nOpen redirect via vectors including the \"destination\" URL parameter:\n\n  * [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/David_Rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Hunter Fox](<https://www.drupal.org/u/hefox>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Tom Phethean](<http://drupal.org/user/881620>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Stoline](<http://drupal.org/user/329570>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Damien McKenna](<https://www.drupal.org/user/108450>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Pere Orga](<https://www.drupal.org/u/pere-orga>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Ben Dougherty](<http://drupal.org/u/benjy>), provisional member of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [The Drupal Security Team](<https://www.drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

      "description": "Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 include an XML-RPC endpoint which is publicly available (xmlrpc.php). The PHP XML parser used by this XML-RPC endpoint is vulnerable to an XML entity expansion attack and other related XML payload attacks which can cause CPU and memory exhaustion and the site's database to reach the maximum number of open connections. Any of these may lead to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of service).\n\nAll Drupal sites are vulnerable to this attack whether XML-RPC is used or not.\n\nIn addition, a similar vulnerability exists in the core OpenID module (for sites that have this module enabled).\n\nThis is a joint release as the XML-RPC vulnerability also affects WordPress (see the [announcement](<https://wordpress.org/news/2014/08/wordpress-3-9-2/>)).\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * _CVE-2014-5265_ [has been issued](<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/16/4>) for the code changes in xmlrpc.inc which prevent entity declarations and therefore address the \"vulnerable to an XML entity expansion attack ... can cause CPU and memory exhaustion\" concern.\n  * _CVE-2014-5266_ [has been issued](<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/16/4>) for the \"Skip parsing if there is an unreasonably large number of tags\" in both xmlrpc.inc and xrds.inc.\n  * _CVE-2014-5267_ [has been issued](<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/16/4>) for the code change to reject any XRDS document with a /&lt;!DOCTYPE/i match.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.31.\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.33.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.31](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.31-release-notes>).\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.33](<http://drupal.org/drupal-6.33-release-notes>).\n\nIf you are unable to install the latest version of Drupal immediately, you can alternatively remove the xmlrpc.php file from the root of Drupal core (or add a rule to .htaccess to prevent access to xmlrpc.php) and disable the OpenID module. These steps are sufficient to mitigate the vulnerability in Drupal core if your site does not require the use of XML-RPC or OpenID functionality. However, this mitigation will not be effective if you are using a contributed module that exposes Drupal's XML-RPC API at a different URL (for example, the Services module); updating Drupal core is therefore strongly recommended.\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * [Willis Vandevanter](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1867894>)\n  * [Nir Goldshlager](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2891345>)\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * [Andrew Nacin](<http://profiles.wordpress.org/nacin>) of the WordPress Security Team\n  * [Michael Adams](<http://profiles.wordpress.org/mdawaffe>) of the WordPress Security Team\n  * [Frédéric Marand](<https://www.drupal.org/user/27985>)\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Damien Tournoud](<https://www.drupal.org/user/22211>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Greg Knaddison](<https://www.drupal.org/u/greggles>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Stéphane Corlosquet](<https://www.drupal.org/user/52142>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Dave Reid](<https://www.drupal.org/user/53892>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * The [Drupal Security Team](<http://drupal.org/security-team>) and the [WordPress](<http://wordpress.org>) Security Team\n",

      "description": "Drupal 7 includes a database abstraction API to ensure that queries executed against the database are sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\nA vulnerability in this API allows an attacker to send specially crafted requests resulting in arbitrary SQL execution. Depending on the content of the requests this can lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary PHP execution, or other attacks.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users.\n\n**Update:** Multiple exploits have been reported in the wild following the release of this security advisory, and Drupal 7 sites which did not update soon after the advisory was released may be compromised. See this follow-up announcement for more information: <https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003>\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * CVE-2014-3704\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.32.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.32](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.32-release-notes>).\n\nIf you are unable to update to Drupal 7.32 you can apply [this patch](<https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/SA-CORE-2014-005-D7.patch>) to Drupal's database.inc file to fix the vulnerability until such time as you are able to completely upgrade to Drupal 7.32.\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page and the [follow-up public service announcement](<https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003>).\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * Stefan Horst\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * Stefan Horst\n  * [Greg Knaddison](<https://www.drupal.org/u/greggles>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands](<https://www.drupal.org/u/larowlan>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/u/david_rothstein>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Klaus Purer](<https://www.drupal.org/u/klausi>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Coordinated by\n\n  * [The Drupal Security Team](<https://www.drupal.org/security-team>)\n",

      "description": "CVE: CVE-2011-2687\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### Reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in error handler\n\nA reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was discovered in Drupal's error handler. Drupal displays PHP errors in the messages area, and a specially crafted URL can cause malicious scripts to be injected into the message. The issue can be mitigated by disabling on-screen error display at admin/settings/error-reporting. This is the recommended setting for production sites.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n### Cross site scripting vulnerability in Color module\n\nWhen using re-colorable themes, color inputs are not sanitized. Malicious color values can be used to insert arbitrary CSS and script code. Successful exploitation requires the \"Administer themes\" permission.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x and 7.x.\n\n### Access bypass in File module\n\nWhen using private files in combination with a node access module, the File module allows unrestricted access to private files.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 7.x only.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 7.x before version 7.1.\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.21.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 7.x then upgrade to Drupal [7.1](<http://drupal.org/node/1168910>) or [7.2](<http://drupal.org/node/1168946>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to Drupal [6.21](<http://drupal.org/node/1168908>) or [6.22.](<http://drupal.org/node/1168950>)\n\nThe Security Team has released both a pure security update without other bug fixes and a security update combined with other bug fixes and improvements. You can choose to either only include the security update for an immediate fix (which might require less quality assurance and testing) or more fixes and improvements alongside the security fixes by choosing between [Drupal 7.1](<http://drupal.org/node/1168910>) and [Drupal 7.2](<http://drupal.org/node/1168946>) or [Drupal 6.21](<http://drupal.org/node/1168908>) and [Drupal 6.22](<http://drupal.org/node/1168950>). \n\nSee the [release announcement](<http://drupal.org/drupal-7.2>) for more information.\n\nSee also the [Drupal core](<http://drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was reported by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).\n  * The Color module cross site scripting vulnerability was reported by Kasper Lindgaard, Secunia Research.\n  * The File access bypass was reported by Hubert Lecorche, and [Peter Bex](<https://drupal.org/user/309898>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\n  * The reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was fixed by Alan Smithee.\n  * The Color module cross site scripting vulnerability was fixed by [Stéphane Corlosquet](<http://drupal.org/user/52142>) (*), [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*), and [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>) (*).\n  * The File access bypass was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) (*).\n\n(*) Member of the Drupal security team.\n",

      "description": "This security advisory fixes multiple vulnerabilities. See below for a list.\n\n## Cross-site Scripting - Ajax system - Drupal 7\n\nA vulnerability was found that allows a malicious user to perform a cross-site scripting attack by invoking Drupal.ajax() on a whitelisted HTML element.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated on sites that do not allow untrusted users to enter HTML.\n\nDrupal 6 core is not affected, but see the similar advisory for the Drupal 6 contributed Ctools module: [SA-CONTRIB-2015-141](<https://www.drupal.org/node/2554145>). \n\n## Cross-site Scripting - Autocomplete system - Drupal 6 and 7\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the autocomplete functionality of forms. The requested URL is not sufficiently sanitized.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the malicious user must be allowed to upload files.\n\n## SQL Injection - Database API - Drupal 7\n\nA vulnerability was found in the SQL comment filtering system which could allow a user with elevated permissions to inject malicious code in SQL comments.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that only one contributed module that the security team found uses the comment filtering system in a way that would trigger the vulnerability. That module requires you to have a very high level of access in order to perform the attack.\n\n## Cross-site Request Forgery - Form API - Drupal 6 and 7\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in Drupal's form API that could allow file upload value callbacks to run with untrusted input, due to form token validation not being performed early enough. This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to upload files to the site under another user's account.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the uploaded files would be temporary, and Drupal normally deletes temporary files automatically after 6 hours.\n\n## Information Disclosure in Menu Links - Access system - Drupal 6 and 7\n\nUsers without the \"access content\" permission can see the titles of nodes that they do not have access to, if the nodes are added to a menu on the site that the users have access to.\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Cross-site Scripting (Ajax system - Drupal 7): **CVE-2015-6665**\n  * Cross-site Scripting (Autocomplete system - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2015-6658**\n  * SQL Injection (Database API - Drupal 7): **CVE-2015-6659**\n  * Cross-site Request Forgery (Form API - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2015-6660**\n  * Information Disclosure in Menu Links (Access system - Drupal 6 and 7): **CVE-2015-6661**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 6.x versions prior to 6.37\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.39\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 6.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 6.37](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.37-release-notes>)\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.39](<https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39-release-notes>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Credits\n\n### Cross-site Scripting -

      "description": "When contributed modules such as Workflow NG terminate the current request during a login event, user module is not able to regenerate the user's session. This may lead to a [session fixation attack](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation>), when a malicious user is able to control another users' initial session ID. As the session is not regenerated, the malicious user may use the 'fixed' session ID after the victim authenticates and will have the same access. \n\nThe advisory [SA-2008-044](<http://drupal.org/node/280571>) claims that this session fixation vulnerability was fixed in Drupal 5.8 and 6.3. Unfortunately, Drupal 5.8 still contains this vulnerability.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.9\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.9](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.9.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. The patches fix security vulnerabilities, but do not contain other fixes which were released in these versions.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 5.8 use [SA-2008-046-5.8.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-046/SA-2008-046-5.8.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The session fixation issue was originally reported by Erich C.

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### Cross site scripting\n\nA bug in the output filter employed by Drupal makes it possible for malicious users to insert script code into pages ([cross site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>) or XSS). \n\nA bug in the private filesystem trusts the MIME type sent by the browser, enabling malicious users with the ability to upload files to execute cross site scripting attacks.\n\nThese bugs affects both Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Arbitrary file uploads via BlogAPI\n\nThe BlogAPI module does not validate the extension of uploaded files, enabling users with the \"administer content with blog api\" permission to upload harmful files.\n\nThis bug affects both Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Cross site request forgeries\n\nDrupal forms contain a token to protect against [cross site request forgeries](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>) (CSRF). The token may not be validated properly for cached forms and forms containing AHAH elements.\n\nThis bug affects Drupal 6.x.\n\nUser access rules can be added or deleted upon accessing a properly formatted URL, making such modifications vulnerable to cross site request forgeries (CSRF). This may lead to unintended addition or deletion of an access rule when a sufficiently privileged user visits a page or site created by a malicious person.\n\nThis bug affects both Drupal 5.x and 6.x.\n\n### Various Upload module vulnerabilities\n\nThe Upload module in Drupal 6 contains privilege escalation vulnerabilities for users with the \"upload files\" permission. This can lead to users being able to edit nodes which they are normally not allowed to, delete any file to which the webserver has sufficient rights, and download attachments of nodes to which they have no access. Harmful files may also be uploaded via cross site request forgeries (CSRF).\n\nThese bugs affect Drupal 6.x.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.10\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.4\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.10](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.10.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.4](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.4.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade.

      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities and weaknesses were discovered in Drupal.\n\n### Cross-site scripting\n\nThe Forum module does not correctly handle certain arguments obtained from the URL. By enticing a suitably privileged user to visit a specially crafted URL, a malicious user is able to insert arbitrary HTML and script code into forum pages. Such a cross-site scripting attack may lead to the malicious user gaining administrative access. Wikipedia has more information about [cross-site scripting](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>) (XSS).\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n### Input format access bypass\n\nUser signatures have no separate input format, they use the format of the comment with which they are displayed. A user will no longer be able to edit a comment when an administrator changes the comment's input format to a format that is not accessible to the user. However they will still be able to modify their signature, which will then be processed by the new input format. \n\nIf the new format is very permissive, via their signature, the user may be able to insert arbitrary HTML and script code into pages or, when the PHP filter is enabled for the new format, execute PHP code.\n\nThis issue affects Drupal 6.x only.\n\n### Password leaked in URL\n\nWhen an anonymous user fails to login due to mistyping his username or password, and the page he is on contains a sortable table, the (incorrect) username and password are included in links on the table. If the user visits these links the password may then be leaked to external sites via the HTTP referer.\n\nIn addition, if the anonymous user is enticed to visit the site via a specially crafted URL while the Drupal page cache is enabled, a malicious user might be able to retrieve the (incorrect) username and password from the page cache.\n\nThis issue affects both Drupal 5.x and Drupal 6.x\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 5.x before version 5.19.\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.13.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.13](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.13.tar.gz>).\n  * If you are running Drupal 5.x then upgrade to [Drupal 5.19](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-5.19.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. Theses patches fix the security vulnerability, but do not contain other fixes which were released in Drupal 5.19 or Drupal 6.13.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.12 use [SA-CORE-2009-007-6.12.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-007/SA-CORE-2009-007-6.12.patch>).\n  * To patch Drupal 5.18 use [SA-CORE-2009-007-5.18.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-core-2009-007/SA-CORE-2009-007-5.18.patch>).\n\n## Reported by\n\nThe forum XSS issue was independently reported by Mark Piper of Catalyst IT Ltd, Sven Herrmann and Brandon Knight.  \nThe user signature issue was reported by [Gerhard Killesreiter](<http://drupal.org/user/227>) of the Drupal security team.  \nThe password in URL issue was reported by [Sumit Datta](<http://drupal.org/user/59022>).\n\n## Fixed by\n\nThe forum XSS issue was fixed by [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>), [Peter Wolanin](<http://drupal.org/user/49851>) and [Charlie Gordon](<http://drupal.org/user/157412>).  \nThe user signature issue was fixed by [David Rothstein](<http://drupal.org/user/124982>), [Charlie Gordon](<http://drupal.org/user/157412>), [Heine Deelstra](<http://drupal.org/user/17943>) and [Gábor Hojtsy](<http://drupal.org/user/4166>).  \nThe password in URL issue was fixed by [Damien Tournoud](<http://drupal.org/user/22211>) and [Bart Jansens](<http://drupal.org/user/5330>).\n",

      "description": "The menu system routes page requests to appropriate handlers. It also determines whether a user has access to pages based on several criteria, such as permissions assigned to a role. Drupal 6 features an entirely revised menu system, including changes to the way access is dealt with, which if not properly understood by developers can lead to vulnerabilities. This security release provides a more secure access behaviour by default, and fixes incorrectly set menu items in Drupal core.\n\nAccess to some pages was not appropriately controlled:\n\n  * Any user can edit profile pages of other users.\n  * Users who can view administration pages are able to edit content types.\n  * The tracker and blog pages expose information to users without the \"access content\" permission.\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal 6.x before version 6.2.\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you are running Drupal 6.x then upgrade to [Drupal 6.2](<http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-6.2.tar.gz>).\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade immediately, you can apply a patch to secure your installation until you are able to do a proper upgrade. The patch fixes incorrectly set menu items in Drupal core, but does not contain the menu API change which would provide secure defaults. This patch is a temporary solution to be used if modules are required which are still incompatible with the new API changes.\n\n  * To patch Drupal 6.1 use [SA-2008-026-6.1c.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-026/SA-2008-026-6.1c.patch>).\n\n**If you used [SA-2008-026-6.1.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-026/SA-2008-026-6.1-old.patch>) or [SA-2008-026-6.1b.patch](<http://drupal.org/files/sa-2008-026/SA-2008-026-6.1b-old.patch>)**: the patch was incorrect. Please reverse the patch, such as `patch -R`, and apply the current patch.\n\n### Important notes\n\nIt is essential to follow this process when updating:\n\n  * First make sure that you are logged in as user number 1 or that your site's settings.php has $update_free_access = TRUE; so that anyone can access the update.php script while you update the site. We suggest you log in as user 1 because you might have difficulties in gaining write access to your settings file.\n  * Turn your site into offline mode.\n  * Then, and only then replace your Drupal source code files with the new ones from Drupal 6.2.\n  * Run update.php.\n  * Turn your site back to online mode.\n  * If you edited your site's settings.php, make sure to set $update_free_access = FALSE;\n\nIf you do not follow the above procedure, and just replace the source files, any attempt to access the site will be greeted with the message: \"Fatal error: Call to undefined function user_uid_optional_to_arg() in includes/menu.inc on line 594\" and you will have no way to set the site to offline mode on the web interface until you get through update.php.\n\nContributed modules may require an update to work properly with Drupal 6.2. Failing to update modules will lead to some pages of the affected modules not being accessible. \n\n## Note for Module developers\n\nDrupal 6.2 contains two API changes.\n\n  * Menu access callbacks are no longer inherited from parent items.\n  * %user_current has been renamed to %user_uid_optional.\n\nAdditional information can be found in [Updating your 6.x module to work with 6.2](<http://drupal.org/node/244569>).\n\n## Reported by\n\n  * The tracker and profile access issue were respectively reported by Peter Wolanin and Greg Knaddison of the Drupal security team.\n",

      "description": "Project: \n\nDrupal core\n\nDate: \n\n2019-February-20\n\nSecurity risk: \n\n**Highly critical** 23∕25 AC:None/A:None/CI:All/II:All/E:Exploit/TD:Uncommon\n\nVulnerability: \n\nRemote Code Execution\n\nCVE IDs: \n\nCVE-2019-6340\n\nDescription: \n\nSome field types do not properly sanitize data from non-form sources. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some cases.\n\nA site is only affected by this if one of the following conditions is met:\n\n  * The site has the Drupal 8 core RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled and allows **GET**, PATCH or POST requests, or\n  * the site has another web services module enabled, like [JSON:API](<https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi>) in Drupal 8, or [Services](<https://www.drupal.org/project/services>) or [RESTful Web Services](<https://www.drupal.org/project/restws>) in Drupal 7. \n\n(_Note: The Drupal 7 Services module itself does not require an update at this time, but you should still apply other contributed updates associated with this advisory if Services is in use._)\n\n## Updates\n\n  * **2019-02-20**: Updated risk score given new information; see [PSA-2019-02-22](<https://www.drupal.org/psa-2019-02-22>). The security risk score has been updated to 23/25 as there are now known exploits in the wild. In addition, any enabled REST resource end-point, **even if it only accepts GET requests**, is also vulnerable. Note this does not include REST exports from Views module.\n\nSolution: \n\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.6.x, upgrade to [Drupal 8.6.10](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.6.10>).\n  * If you are using Drupal 8.5.x or earlier, upgrade to [Drupal 8.5.11](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.11>).\n  * Be sure to install any available security updates for contributed projects after updating Drupal core.\n  * No core update is required for Drupal 7, but several Drupal 7 contributed modules do require updates.\n\nVersions of Drupal 8 prior to 8.5.x are end-of-life and do not receive security coverage.\n\nTo immediately mitigate the vulnerability, you can disable all web services modules, or configure your web server(s) to not allow **GET**/PUT/PATCH/POST requests to web services resources. Note that web services resources may be available on multiple paths depending on the configuration of your server(s). For Drupal 7, resources are for example typically available via paths (clean URLs) and via arguments to the \"q\" query argument. For Drupal 8, paths may still function when prefixed with index.php/.\n\nReported By: \n\n  * [Samuel Mortenson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2582268>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nFixed By: \n\n  * [Sascha Grossenbacher ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/214652>)\n  * [Peter Wolanin ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/49851>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Samuel Mortenson ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2582268>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Daniel Wehner ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99340>)\n  * [Cash Williams ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/421070>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Wim Leers ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99777>)\n  * [Jess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Pott ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/157725>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Francesco Placella ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/183211>)\n  * [Damian Lee ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1037976>)\n  * [Tobias Zimmermann ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/107158>)\n  * [Ted Bowman ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/240860>)\n  * [Damien McKenna ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/108450>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Alex Bronstein ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/78040>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Rob Loach ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/61114>)\n  * [Gabe Sullice ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/2287430>)\n  * [Michael Hess ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/102818>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Neil Drumm ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/3064>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Heshan Wanigasooriya ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/199102>)\n  * [David Snopek ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/266527>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Wolfgang Ziegler ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/16747>)\n  * [Miro Dietiker ](<https://www.drupal.org/user/227761>)\n  * [Truls S.

      "description": "### Saving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles (User module - Drupal 7 - Moderately Critical)\n\nA vulnerability exists in the User module, where if some specific contributed or custom code triggers a rebuild of the user profile form, a registered user can be granted all user roles on the site. This would typically result in the user gaining administrative access.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that it requires contributed or custom code that performs a form rebuild during submission of the user profile form.\n\n### Views can allow unauthorized users to see Statistics information (Views module - Drupal 8 - Less Critical)\n\nAn access bypass vulnerability exists in the Views module, where users without the \"View content count\" permission can see the number of hits collected by the Statistics module for results in the view.\n\nThis issue is mitigated by the fact that the view must be configured to show a \"Content statistics\" field, such as \"Total views\", \"Views today\" or \"Last visit\".\n\nThe same vulnerability exists in the Drupal 7 Views module (see [SA-CONTRIB-2016-036](<https://www.drupal.org/node/2749333>)).\n\n## CVE identifier(s) issued\n\n  * Saving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles: **CVE-2016-6211**\n  * Views can allow unauthorized users to see Statistics information: **CVE-2016-6212**\n\n## Versions affected\n\n  * Drupal core 7.x versions prior to 7.44\n  * Drupal core 8.x versions prior to 8.1.3\n\n## Solution\n\nInstall the latest version:\n\n  * If you use Drupal 7.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 7.44](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.44>)\n  * If you use Drupal 8.x, upgrade to [Drupal core 8.1.3](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.1.3>)\n\nAlso see the [Drupal core](<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal>) project page.\n\n## Reported by\n\nSaving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles:\n\n  * [alfaguru](<https://www.drupal.org/user/112814>)\n\nViews can allow unauthorized users to see Statistics information:\n\n  * [Nickolay Leshchev](<https://www.drupal.org/user/982724>)\n\n## Fixed by\n\nSaving user accounts can sometimes grant the user all roles:\n\n  * [Ben Dougherty](<https://www.drupal.org/user/1852732>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Balazs Nagykekesi](<https://www.drupal.org/user/21231>)\n  * [David Rothstein](<https://www.drupal.org/user/124982>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Lee Rowlands](<https://www.drupal.org/user/395439>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Stefan Ruijsenaars](<https://www.drupal.org/user/551886>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [vlad.k](<https://www.drupal.org/user/731068>)\n  * [Peter Wolanin](<https://www.drupal.org/user/49851>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\nViews can allow unauthorized users to see Statistics information:\n\n  * [Nathaniel Catchpole](<https://www.drupal.org/user/35733>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Greg Knaddison](<https://www.drupal.org/user/36762>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Nickolay Leshchev](<https://www.drupal.org/user/982724>)\n  * [Stefan Ruijsenaars](<https://www.drupal.org/user/551886>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [David Snopek](<https://www.drupal.org/user/266527>) of the Drupal Security Team\n  * [Daniel Wehner](<https://www.drupal.org/user/99340>)\n  * [xjm](<https://www.drupal.org/user/65776>) of the Drupal Security Team\n\n## Coordinated by\n\nThe Drupal Security Team\n",
